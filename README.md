# 📘 Machine Learning Projects from Scratch

Welcome to my **Machine Learning project repository**!  
This repo documents my **learning journey in ML** through a **project-based approach** — starting from the very basics (linear regression) and moving towards advanced topics (deep learning, NLP, and AI agents).  

---

## 📌 Why this repo?
- To learn ML by **building projects instead of just reading theory**  
- To create a **portfolio** that showcases real-world ML skills  
- To track my **progress step by step**

## 🚀 Roadmap

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundations (Python + Data Handling)
- [Project 1: Predict Student Scores (Linear Regression)](./Project-1-Linear-Regression-Student-Scores)
- [Project 2: Student Pass Fail Classification](https://github.com/MRuhan17/ML-labs/tree/main/student-pass-fail-classification)
- (Upcoming) Project 3: Data Visualization Experiments

### 🔹 Phase 2: Core ML (Supervised + Unsupervised)
- Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification)
- Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
- Customer Segmentation (Clustering with K-Means)

### 🔹 Phase 3: Applied ML Projects
- Spam Email Classifier (NLP)
- Stock Price Prediction (Time Series)
- Fake News Detection (NLP)

### 🔹 Phase 4: Deep Learning & Advanced ML
- Image Classification with CNNs
- Chatbot using Transformers
