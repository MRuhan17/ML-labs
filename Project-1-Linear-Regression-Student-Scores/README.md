# 📘 Project 1: Predict Student Scores using Linear Regression

## 📌 Objective  
To predict student exam scores based on the number of hours studied using a **Linear Regression model**.  
This is the **first project** in my Machine Learning journey, focusing on understanding the basics of supervised learning.

## 📊 Dataset  
A simple dataset with "Hours Studied" as input and "Scores" as output:  

| Hours | Scores |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 35     |
| 2     | 40     |
| 3     | 50     |
| 4     | 65     |
| 5     | 75     |
| 6     | 85     |
| 7     | 88     |
| 8     | 95     |
| 9     | 99     |

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- **pandas** → dataset handling  
- **scikit-learn** → Linear Regression model  
- **matplotlib** → data visualization  

---

## 🚀 Steps
1. Prepare dataset  
2. Train Linear Regression model  
3. Predict exam scores for new study hours  
4. Visualize regression line with actual data  

---

## 📈 Results
- Learned the relationship between study hours and exam scores  
- Equation of best-fit line:  
  \[
  y = mX + c
  \]  
  (model finds `m` = slope, `c` = intercept)  
- Model predicts ~92 marks for **7.5 hours of study**
